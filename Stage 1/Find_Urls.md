######Find Urls
In order to find extra information about the site, we can try using a custom google search like `'inurl:averyhardtest.com'`. This reveals a url of `averyhardtest.com/stage/2a`. Furthermore, if we use words found on the 4 pages discovered so far to test urls, we come up with `averyhardtest.com/users`.
