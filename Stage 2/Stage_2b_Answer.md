######Stage 2b Answer
We now know that to authenticate with stage 2b, we need to find Ivan's password. From earlier, we have the `averyhardtest.com/users` url, and it is possible to query usernames from the url. Testing several common usernames we find `averyhardtest.com/users?username=bob`, which responds with a JSON string with a name field, a username field, and a password field. Note that the first name and the username aren't identical. The information appears to belong to a Twitter account (the password doesn't work of course)

The hint is that the password is "Not Alpine". Googling the phrase reveals that "alpine" is used as the default root password on some jailbroken iPhones. Googling "ivan" and "apple" leads us to a wikipedia page on Ivan Krstić, who is in fact on Twitter as @radian. `averyhardtest.com/users?username=radian` responds with a JSON string verifying that the username belongs to Ivan Krstić, and reveals his password to be `rnipletpto`. These correctly authenticate with stage 2b.
